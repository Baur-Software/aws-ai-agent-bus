## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Dashboard UI** (SolidJS): Visual workflow designer with live execution monitoring
- **Dashboard Server** (Node.js): WebSocket-based pub/sub backend with multi-tenant agent management
- **MCP Server** (Node.js): Model Context Protocol server providing AI context and tool execution
- **Internal MCP Registry**: Versioned registry of connected MCP servers with fork support
- **Multi-Tenant Agent Storage**: S3/DynamoDB-backed agent system with path-based security
- **Live Workflow Engine**: Real-time execution state management with event streaming
- **Human Notification System**: Multi-channel notifications (Slack, email, SMS) for human workflow nodes

### Data Architecture

**Agent Storage**:
```
S3: agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/system/              # Bootstrap agents from .claude/agents
â”œâ”€â”€ public/community/           # Community-shared agents
â”œâ”€â”€ organizations/{orgId}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/                # Org-wide agents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generated/{mcpId}/     # Auto-generated from MCP servers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ users/{userId}/        # User private agents within org
â””â”€â”€ users/{userId}/            # Individual user agents
```

**Multi-Tenant Context**:
- **Organizations**: Multiple users, shared resources, admin controls
- **Users**: Individual workspaces, private agents, personal integrations
- **MCP Tenant Isolation**: Each user/org has isolated MCP server context

### Technical Stack

- Frontend: SolidJS with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js MCP server with stdio/HTTP interfaces
- Infrastructure: AWS (DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge, Step Functions)
- AI Integration: OpenAI/Claude via MCP protocol

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/aws-ai-agent-bus
cd aws-ai-agent-bus

# Start the dashboard UI
cd dashboard-ui
npm install
npm run dev

# Start the MCP server (separate terminal)
cd ../mcp-server
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Try the Interface

Open http://localhost:5173 to access:

1. **Visual Canvas**: Design workflows with drag-and-drop
2. **Business Templates**: Pre-built process flows
3. **Chat Assistant**: Get AI suggestions (currently mock responses)
4. **Process Library**: Browse and manage your workflows

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure (Optional)

```bash
# Deploy AWS components for MCP server
export WS=small/kv_store ENV=dev
npm run tf:init
npm run tf:apply
```

## Use Cases

### **Human-in-the-Loop Operations**

**Financial Approval Workflows**:
```
API Request â†’ Data Validation â†’ Human Approval â†’ Payment Processing â†’ Notification
    ðŸ¤–             ðŸ¤–               ðŸ‘¤                ðŸ¤–               ðŸ¤–
```
- Finance manager gets Slack notification for payments >$10k
- Mobile-friendly approval with full context
- Automatic escalation if no response within 2 hours

**Customer Onboarding with Review**:
```
Form Submission â†’ Data Enrichment â†’ Compliance Check â†’ Manual Review â†’ Account Creation
      ðŸ¤–               ðŸ¤–               ðŸ¤–             ðŸ‘¤              ðŸ¤–
```
- Compliance officer reviews flagged applications
- Customizable notification preferences per person
- Real-time workflow state visible to all stakeholders

### **Auto-Generated Integration Workflows**

**Connect Stripe â†’ Instant Specialized Agents**:
1. User connects Stripe MCP server to tenant context
2. System auto-generates: `stripe-payments-expert`, `stripe-webhooks-specialist`, `stripe-subscriptions-manager`
3. Workflow nodes populate with Stripe capabilities
4. Pre-built payment processing workflows become available

**GitHub Integration â†’ Development Workflows**:
1. Connect GitHub MCP server
2. Auto-generate: `github-pr-manager`, `github-deployment-specialist`, `github-issue-tracker`
3. CI/CD workflow templates with human review gates
4. Automatic agent updates when MCP server versions change

### **Multi-Tenant Agent Management**

**Organization-Level Sharing**:
- `acme-corp` creates custom `salesforce-lead-qualifier` agent
- Available to all `acme-corp` users in workflow designer
- Version controlled with change logs

**Personal Agent Development**:
- Individual users create private specialized agents
- Fork organization agents for personal customization
- Markdown editor with live preview and templates
