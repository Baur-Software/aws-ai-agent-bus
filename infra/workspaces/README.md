## Deployment Guide

### 1. Choose Your Tier
```bash
# For individual development
export WS=extra-small ENV=dev

# For small team development
export WS=small ENV=dev

# For production workloads
export WS=medium ENV=prod

# For enterprise deployment
export WS=large ENV=prod
```

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
# Initialize Terraform
npm run tf:init

# Plan deployment
npm run tf:plan

# Apply infrastructure
npm run tf:apply
```

### 3. Scale Up When Ready
Move between tiers by deploying the next level:
```bash
# Graduate from extra-small to small
export WS=small ENV=dev
npm run tf:apply

# The new workspace includes all previous components
# plus additional features for the new tier
```

## Cost Optimization Tips

### For extra-small workspaces:
- Use Fargate Spot (70% savings)
- No ALB (save ~$18/month)
- Short log retention (7 days)
- On-demand DynamoDB only

### For all workspaces:
- Monitor usage with AWS Cost Explorer
- Set up billing alerts
- Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Consider Savings Plans for Fargate

### Upgrade path:
- Start with extra-small for development
- Move to small when you need external access
- Scale to medium for production features
- Upgrade to large for enterprise requirements
