## Authentication Patterns
```typescript
const authConfig = {
  type: "oauth2",
  oauth2: {
    authorization_url: "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",
    token_url: "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",
    scopes: [
      "repo", "read:user", "user:email",
      "admin:org", "read:org",
      "workflow", "actions"
    ],
    grant_type: "authorization_code"
  },
  app_authentication: {
    type: "github_app",
    private_key_required: true,
    installation_access_tokens: true
  },
  refresh_strategy: "long_lived_token"
};
```

## Error Handling Patterns
```typescript
const errorPatterns = {
  "401": {
    message: "Authentication failed or token expired",
    retry_strategy: "refresh_token",
    recovery_action: "re_authenticate"
  },
  "403": {
    message: "Forbidden - insufficient permissions or rate limited",
    retry_strategy: "exponential_backoff",
    recovery_action: "check_permissions_and_rate_limit"
  },
  "404": {
    message: "Repository or resource not found",
    retry_strategy: "no_retry",
    recovery_action: "validate_resource_exists"
  },
  "409": {
    message: "Conflict - resource already exists or merge conflict",
    retry_strategy: "no_retry",
    recovery_action: "resolve_conflict"
  },
  "422": {
    message: "Validation failed - invalid request data",
    retry_strategy: "no_retry",
    recovery_action: "validate_request_data"
  }
};
```

## Rate Limiting Strategy
```typescript
const rateLimitStrategy = {
  requests_per_hour: 5000,
  search_requests_per_minute: 30,
  graphql_points_per_hour: 5000,
  backoff_strategy: "exponential_backoff",
  queue_size: 200,
  priority_levels: ["critical", "normal", "background"],
  rate_limit_headers: [
    "X-RateLimit-Limit",
    "X-RateLimit-Remaining",
    "X-RateLimit-Reset"
  ]
};
```

## Best Practices
- **Authentication**: Use GitHub Apps for enhanced security and higher rate limits
- **GraphQL Usage**: Prefer GraphQL for complex queries to reduce API calls
- **Webhook Security**: Verify webhook signatures using shared secrets
- **Pagination**: Handle pagination for large result sets using link headers
- **Branch Protection**: Implement branch protection rules for critical workflows
- **Security Scanning**: Enable and monitor security scanning features

## Common Workflows

### Automated Code Review
Streamlined PR creation and review process

**Steps:**
1. Create feature branch from main/master
2. Implement changes and create commits
3. Create pull request with automated template
4. Trigger automated checks and tests
5. Request reviews from appropriate team members
6. Address feedback and update PR
7. Merge PR and clean up feature branch

**MCP Tools Used:** `github_create_pr`, `github_merge_pr`, `github_get_commits`

### Issue Triage and Management
Automated issue processing and assignment

**Steps:**
1. Receive new issue webhook notification
2. Analyze issue content for classification
3. Apply appropriate labels and priority
4. Assign to relevant team members
5. Add to project board or milestone
6. Send notifications to stakeholders
7. Track progress and resolution

**MCP Tools Used:** `github_create_issue`, `github_triage_issues`, `github_update_issue`

### Release Management
Automated versioning and release process

**Steps:**
1. Trigger release workflow from main branch
2. Calculate next version based on commit history
3. Generate changelog from pull requests and issues
4. Create release tag and GitHub release
5. Build and upload release artifacts
6. Deploy to staging and production environments
7. Notify teams and update documentation

**MCP Tools Used:** `github_create_release`, `github_trigger_workflow`, `github_upload_asset`

## Delegation Triggers
Use this specialist when:
- "GitHub" appears in user requests
- Working with source code repositories
- Pull request and code review workflows
- Issue tracking and project management
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Release and deployment processes
- Team collaboration and permissions
- Security scanning and vulnerability management

## Integration with Agent Mesh
- **Event Publishing**: Publishes repository, PR, and issue events to EventBridge
- **State Management**: Uses KV store for repository metadata and webhook tokens
- **Error Reporting**: Integrates with notification system for build and deployment alerts
- **Metrics**: Tracks API usage, PR merge rates, and issue resolution times

## Response Patterns
Always provide:
1. **Operation Result**: Clear success/failure with GitHub-specific status codes
2. **Data Payload**: Structured GitHub API response with related objects
3. **Next Steps**: Recommended follow-up actions for development workflows
4. **Error Context**: Detailed GitHub error with permission and validation details

## Tool Implementation Template
```typescript
async function executeGitHubOperation(
  operation: string,
  params: Record<string, any>,
  connectionId: string
): Promise<GitHubResponse> {
  // 1. Validate connection and retrieve credentials
  const connection = await getGitHubConnection(connectionId);

  // 2. Prepare API request with authentication
  const request = {
    url: `https://api.github.com${endpoint}`,
    method: operation.method,
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `token ${connection.access_token}`,
      'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json',
      'X-GitHub-Api-Version': '2022-11-28'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(params)
  };

  // 3. Execute with rate limiting and retry logic
  const response = await executeWithGitHubRateLimit(request);

  // 4. Transform response to standard format
  return transformGitHubResponse(response);
}
```
