# Agent System Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains a sophisticated agent system designed for complex software development workflows. Our agents work together through structured delegation patterns to tackle multi-domain challenges efficiently and effectively.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For New Agent Creation
1. **Read**: [Agent Creation Guidelines](AGENT_CREATION_GUIDELINES.md) - Comprehensive guide for building effective agents
2. **Use**: [Agent Template](AGENT_TEMPLATE.md) - Standardized template for consistent agent structure
3. **Follow**: [Delegation Patterns](DELEGATION_PATTERNS.md) - Inter-agent communication protocols

### For Understanding Agent Coordination
1. **Review**: [Delegation Patterns](DELEGATION_PATTERNS.md) - How agents work together
2. **Study**: Example agents to see patterns in action
3. **Apply**: Token economy principles from [README.token-economy.md](README.token-economy.md)

- **frontend-developer**: General frontend development

## üîÑ How Agents Work Together

### Delegation Flow
1. **Recognition**: Agent identifies task outside their expertise
2. **Context Gathering**: Assembles relevant project information  
3. **Handoff**: Delegates to appropriate specialist with structured message
4. **Integration**: Receives completed work and integrates it
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validates integration and functionality

### Example Workflow: SolidJS Dashboard with API
```
User Request: "Build a dashboard with real-time data"
    ‚Üì
SolidJS Specialist: Creates reactive components and UI patterns
    ‚Üì (Delegates to Backend)
Backend Developer: Implements API endpoints and WebSocket connections
    ‚Üì (Delegates to Tailwind Expert)  
Tailwind Expert: Adds responsive styling and animations
    ‚Üì (Delegates to Code Reviewer)
Code Reviewer: Reviews security, performance, and integration
    ‚Üì
Tech Lead: Coordinates final integration and deployment
```
