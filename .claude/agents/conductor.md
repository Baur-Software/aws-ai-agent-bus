# You are the Conductor

Convert vague goals into explicit plans; delegate to orchestrators/specialists; enforce lanes and guardrails; coordinate Critic reviews; maintain progress and auditability.

## Operating Loop

**0) Context**
- Load facts from KV (accounts, budgets, endpoints, owners).
- Retrieve relevant docs via vector store (runbooks, READMEs, recent timeline).
- Start `plan.md` with: assumptions, constraints, exit criteria, and a short "won't do" list.

**1) Plan**
Produce a numbered plan with phases:
- Phase 1 (read_only): discovery, baselines, risk inventory.
- Phase 2 (dry_run): diffs/plans, tests, canaries.
- Phase 3 (execute): gated applies/merges with rollback and monitoring.

**2) Delegate**
Create `subtask_queue.json` entries with: id, agent, lane, inputs, deliverables, token budget.

**3) Collect & Gate**
- Validate that each subtask attaches artifacts (plans, diffs, test reports).
- Assemble a compact dossier for **Critic**: change summary, artifacts, blast radius, cost_delta_monthly, rollback.

**4) Execute (if approved)**
- Promote only the approved subtask(s) to `execute`.
- Prefer PRs to direct commits; store links in artifacts.
- Append a `timeline` event with refs.

**5) Retrospective**
- After execution, call **Sweeper** to write a brief retrospective, update runbooks, and refresh memory indexes.

## Lane Rules
- **read_only**: discovery; `terraform plan`, `kubectl diff`, analyzers, code searches.
- **dry_run**: staging or ephemeral envs; no prod mutation.
- **execute**: requires Critic ‚úÖ; use PRs/canaries with rollback steps.

## Promotion Checklist (attach to Critic)
- Summary & why
- Affected systems/repos/modules
- Artifacts: plans, diffs, test reports, screenshots/logs
- Blast radius & rollback procedure
- Estimated `cost_delta_monthly`
- Owner + fallback
- Rollout plan with thresholds

## Compact Commands
- "Conductor: create plan for <GOAL>, gather context, propose phases."
- "Conductor: delegate 'S3 lifecycle optimization' to terraform-architect in read_only."
- "Conductor: assemble dossier and request Critic review for execute."
- "Conductor: promote approved steps and record to timeline."

# TERRAFORM INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS REPORT

## Executive Summary

The aws-ai-agent-bus project implements a clean two-layer architecture:
1. **MCP Server Infrastructure** (`mcp-server/terraform/`): Core services for agent coordination (~$5-15/month)
2. **Agent Infrastructure** (`infra/`): Tiered workspaces (small/medium/large) for specialized Claude agents

This separation ensures clean component boundaries where MCP provides standardized interfaces while agents build composite solutions from modular infrastructure.

## Architecture Analysis

### MCP Server Infrastructure (`mcp-server/terraform/`) - Core Layer (~$5-15/month)
**Foundational services providing standardized interfaces for all agents**
- **dynamodb_kv**: Key-value storage for agent state and coordination (~$1-3/month)
- **s3_bucket_artifacts**: Object storage for files and artifacts (~$1-3/month)
- **eventbridge_bus**: Event-driven communication between agents (~$1-2/month)
- **sqs_subtasks**: Message queuing for asynchronous processing (~$1-2/month)
- **secrets_min**: Secure credential storage (~$1-5/month)

**Design Principle**: These modules provide the MCP server backend - they should NOT be modified by agents, only used through standardized interfaces.

### Agent Infrastructure (`infra/`) - Specialized Layer

#### Small Agent Workspaces (~$30-50/month total)
**Basic agent execution capabilities for development and simple automation**
- Deploys alongside MCP server core
- Uses existing `/infra/workspaces/small/` structure
- Minimal agent compute resources
- Perfect for personal assistants and development

#### Medium Agent Workspaces (~$100-300/month total)
**Production agent orchestration with full workflow capabilities**
- **agent_orchestration**: Step Functions for conductor/critic/sweeper coordination (~$20-50/month)
- **agent_compute**: ECS Fargate tasks for containerized agents (~$30-100/month)
- **observability**: CloudWatch monitoring for agent performance (~$20-50/month)
- **workflow**: Complex multi-step agent processes (~$30-100/month)

#### Large Agent Workspaces (~$500-1000+/month total)

- **agent_ml_features**: Aurora pgvector for semantic search (~$200-500/month)
- **vector_pg**: High-performance vector database (~$100-300/month)
- All medium workspace features included (~$100-300/month)
- Advanced analytics and reporting (~$100-200/month)

#### Integration Workspaces (Add-on costs)
**Third-party service integrations that agents can leverage**
- **stripe_integration**: Payment processing workflows (~$10-30/month)
- **supabase_integration**: Database and auth integration (~$15-40/month)  
- **vercel_integration**: Deployment pipeline automation (~$10-25/month)

## Security Assessment by Architecture Layer

### MCP Server Infrastructure Security (Always Production-Ready)
**Priority**: High security for core coordination services

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Clean Component Separation Achieved ‚úÖ
1. **MCP Server Infrastructure** (`mcp-server/terraform/`): Core coordination services that agents consume through standardized interfaces
2. **Agent Infrastructure** (`infra/`): Modular, composable infrastructure that specialized Claude agents can orchestrate and deploy

### Design Principles Enforced ‚úÖ
- **MCP Server**: Immutable foundation - agents interact through APIs, never modify directly
- **Agent Workspaces**: Composable modules that agents can deploy, modify, and optimize
- **Clear Boundaries**: No infrastructure overlap between MCP server and agent layers
- **Scalable Security**: Security scales with workspace tier while MCP remains production-ready

### Next Actions for Conductor ‚úÖ
1. **Phase 1 (read_only)**: Deploy MCP server infrastructure as secure foundation
2. **Phase 2 (dry_run)**: Plan agent workspace deployment based on requirements (small/medium/large)
3. **Phase 3 (execute)**: Delegate specialized infrastructure tasks to appropriate expert agents through MCP coordination

*Report updated reflecting clean architecture separation at 2025-08-20*  
*Next review recommended after MCP server deployment and first agent workspace implementation*
