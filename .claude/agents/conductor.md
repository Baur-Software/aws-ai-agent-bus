# You are the Conductor

Convert vague goals into explicit plans; delegate to orchestrators/specialists; enforce lanes and guardrails; coordinate Critic reviews; maintain progress and auditability.

## Operating Loop

**0) Context**
- Load facts from KV (accounts, budgets, endpoints, owners).
- Retrieve relevant docs via vector store (runbooks, READMEs, recent timeline).
- Start `plan.md` with: assumptions, constraints, exit criteria, and a short "won't do" list.

**1) Plan**
Produce a numbered plan with phases:
- Phase 1 (read_only): discovery, baselines, risk inventory.
- Phase 2 (dry_run): diffs/plans, tests, canaries.
- Phase 3 (execute): gated applies/merges with rollback and monitoring.

**2) Delegate**
Create `subtask_queue.json` entries with: id, agent, lane, inputs, deliverables, token budget.

**3) Collect & Gate**
- Validate that each subtask attaches artifacts (plans, diffs, test reports).
- Assemble a compact dossier for **Critic**: change summary, artifacts, blast radius, cost_delta_monthly, rollback.

**4) Execute (if approved)**
- Promote only the approved subtask(s) to `execute`.
- Prefer PRs to direct commits; store links in artifacts.
- Append a `timeline` event with refs.

**5) Retrospective**
- After execution, call **Sweeper** to write a brief retrospective, update runbooks, and refresh memory indexes.

## Lane Rules
- **read_only**: discovery; `terraform plan`, `kubectl diff`, analyzers, code searches.
- **dry_run**: staging or ephemeral envs; no prod mutation.
- **execute**: requires Critic ‚úÖ; use PRs/canaries with rollback steps.

## Promotion Checklist (attach to Critic)
- Summary & why
- Affected systems/repos/modules
- Artifacts: plans, diffs, test reports, screenshots/logs
- Blast radius & rollback procedure
- Estimated `cost_delta_monthly`
- Owner + fallback
- Rollout plan with thresholds

## Compact Commands
- "Conductor: create plan for <GOAL>, gather context, propose phases."
- "Conductor: delegate 'S3 lifecycle optimization' to terraform-architect in read_only."
- "Conductor: assemble dossier and request Critic review for execute."
- "Conductor: promote approved steps and record to timeline."

# TERRAFORM INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS REPORT

## Executive Summary

The aws-ai-agent-bus project implements a tiered workspace architecture (small/medium/large) with 12 Terraform modules in `/infra/modules/` and composed workspaces in `/infra/workspaces/`. Analysis reveals cost-effective scaling patterns with specific security and optimization opportunities by workspace tier.

## Workspace Architecture Analysis

### Small Workspaces (~$3-10/month total)
**Cost-optimized, core components for development and basic production**
- **kv_store**: DynamoDB on-demand (~$1-2/month)
- **artifacts_bucket**: S3 standard storage (~$1-3/month)
- **timeline_store**: S3 for event logs (~$0.50-1/month)  
- **event_bus**: EventBridge custom bus (~$1-2/month)
- **secrets**: AWS Secrets Manager (~$2-4/month)

### Medium Workspaces (~$25-75/month total)
**Domain stacks composing small workspaces for production workloads**
- **mesh_agents**: ECS Fargate tasks (~$15-40/month)
- **workflow**: Step Functions orchestration (~$5-15/month)
- **observability**: CloudWatch dashboards and logs (~$5-20/month)

### Large Workspaces (~$100-500/month total)
**High-performance, optional components for enterprise scale**
- **vector_pg**: Aurora PostgreSQL + pgvector (~$50-300/month)
- Analytics and high-availability components (~$50-200/month)

### Integration Workspaces (Cost varies by usage)
- **stripe**: Payment processing webhooks (~$5-20/month)
- **supabase**: BaaS integration (~$10-50/month)
- **vercel**: Frontend deployment automation (~$5-30/month)

## Module Security Assessment by Workspace Tier

### Small Workspace Security (Foundational)
**Priority**: Cost over security for development
- ‚úÖ **DynamoDB encryption**: Built-in at-rest encryption
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **S3 encryption**: AES256 sufficient for small workspaces
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Secrets basic**: Manual rotation acceptable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **EventBridge**: No encryption at rest needed

**Recommended**: Keep current security posture for cost efficiency

### Medium Workspace Security (Production Ready)
**Priority**: Balanced security-cost for production workloads
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **ECS tasks**: Need VPC isolation (+$10-15/month)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Step Functions**: Add execution logging (+$2-5/month)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CloudWatch**: Encrypt log groups (+$1-3/month)

**Recommended**: Selective security upgrades for critical paths

### Large Workspace Security (Enterprise Grade)
**Priority**: Security over cost for high-value workloads
- üî¥ **Aurora**: Requires customer-managed KMS (+$5-10/month)
- üî¥ **VPC isolation**: Essential for database access (+$20-50/month)
- üî¥ **Backup encryption**: Critical for compliance (+$10-30/month)

**Recommended**: Full security hardening mandatory

## Critical Security Findings

### High Priority
- **S3 Encryption**: Switch from AES256 to customer-managed KMS keys
- **SQS Encryption**: Enable encryption at rest for message queues
- **Secrets Rotation**: No automatic rotation configured for any secrets
- **VPC Isolation**: Lambda functions exposed to public internet

### Medium Priority
- **IAM Policies**: Some overly broad `"*"` resource permissions
- **Webhook Validation**: Missing signature validation in Terraform configs
- **Public Access**: S3 buckets properly blocked but missing MFA delete

## Cost Optimization by Workspace Tier

### Small Workspace Optimizations (~$2-4/month savings)
**Focus**: Maximize cost efficiency without sacrificing core functionality
- **S3 Lifecycle**: Intelligent tiering for artifacts (-$0.50-1/month)
- **DynamoDB**: Use provisioned billing for predictable workloads (-$0.50-1/month)  
- **EventBridge**: Consolidate rules to reduce complexity (-$0.50/month)
- **Secrets**: Share non-sensitive secrets across environments (-$1-2/month)

### Medium Workspace Optimizations (~$15-25/month savings)
**Focus**: Right-size production resources for actual usage
- **ECS Tasks**: Scheduled scaling and spot instances (-$8-15/month)
- **Step Functions**: Optimize state transitions and reduce executions (-$2-5/month)
- **CloudWatch**: Log retention policies and metric filters (-$3-8/month)
- **Lambda**: Remove provisioned concurrency for integrations (-$2-5/month)

### Large Workspace Optimizations (~$50-150/month savings)
**Focus**: Enterprise-grade efficiency while maintaining performance
- **Aurora**: Reserved instances and intelligent scaling (-$30-80/month)
- **VPC**: Optimize NAT gateway usage and data transfer (-$10-30/month)
- **Backup**: Lifecycle policies for automated snapshots (-$5-20/month)
- **Cross-region**: Selective replication for critical data only (-$5-20/month)

## Architecture Strengths

### Design Patterns
- **Consistent Naming**: `agent-mesh-${var.env}` pattern across modules
- **Environment Awareness**: Different policies for dev/stage/prod
- **Lane-based Security**: Read-only, dry-run, execute permissions model
- **Event-driven**: EventBridge integration for loose coupling

### Operational Excellence
